## Problem

### Distributing Books Evenly

A school is distributing books among students. Write a program that takes user input for the total number of books and the number of students. Use division (`/`) to calculate how many books each student will receive and modulus (`%`) to determine if any books remain undistributed.

 **Input:** 

- An integer representing the total number of books.
- An integer representing the number of students.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
20
5
```

```
Each student gets 4 books equally.

```

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
23
5
```

```
Each student gets 4 books, but 3 books remain undistributed.

```

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
19
5
```

```
Each student gets 3 books, but 4 books remain undistributed.
```

```java
import java.util.*;

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Taking user input for total books and number of students
        int totalBooks = scanner.nextInt();
        int students = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculating books per student and remaining books
        int each = totalBooks/students;
        int remaining = totalBooks%students;

        // Printing the output based on the condition
        if(remaining == 0){
        System.out.println("Each student gets " +each+" books equally.");
        }else{
        System.out.println("Each student gets " +each+" books equally,but " +remaining+" books remain undistributed.");
        }
    }
}

```
