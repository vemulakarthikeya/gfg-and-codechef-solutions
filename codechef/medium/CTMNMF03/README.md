## Problem

### Worked Example - Repeating a Message

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Declare a boolean condition
        boolean isRunning = true;

        // While loop to print a message while the condition is true
        while (isRunning) {
            System.out.println("The process is running...");
            
            // Changing the condition to false (breaking the loop)
            isRunning = false; 
        }
    }
}

```
