# The Else Statement

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Take an interger input  **a**, and then use the if statement to print " **Big** " (without quotes) if the given number is greater than 100, and use the else statement to print " **Small** " (without quotes) when the number is smaller than or equal to 100.

 **Note:**  After printing the output, you should move the cursor to the new line.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: a = 10
Output: Small
Explanation: 10 is smaller than 100, so our else statement works and we print Small.
```

```
Input: a = 101
Output: Big
Explanation: 101 is greater than 100, so our if statement works and we print Big.
```

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();

        // code here
        if(a > 100){
            System.out.println("Big");
        }else{
            System.out.println("Small");
        }
